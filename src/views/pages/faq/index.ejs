                                Deposit your liquidity provider (LP) tokens into the SnowGlobe with the same token as you. After depositing you will receive S tokens, equivalent to the token pair you deposited. The rewards you receive as a LP are reinvested into the token you deposited. Snowball takes a 20% fee of the rewards you receive as a LP. Compounding happens multiple times per day, depending on the pool size.
